class Burst(DroidCircuit):
    """Circuit burst.

    Generate burst of pulses

    Args:
        rate (cv):
          Frequency control: The default frequency of the burst rate is 1 Hz (one
          trigger per second or 60 BPM if you like). Each volt doubles the frequency. So
          an input of 1 V (a number of 0.1) speeds up to two triggers per second
          (120 BPM), 2 V (0.2) creates triggers at 4 Hz (240 BPM) and so on. On the
          other hand negative voltages reduce the speed, so -1 V (-0.1) will give 0.5 Hz
          (30 BPM) and so on.

        taptempo (trigger):
          Feed a reference clock here and the burst will run at the speed of that clock
          – albeit optionally modified by rate. Please see page 23 for details on using
          taptempo inputs.

        hz (cv):
          Set the frequency in Hz directly by setting a number here. This is exclusive
          to taptempo, but will work in combination with rate.

        trigger (trigger):
          Send a trigger here in order to start the bursts

        reset (trigger):
          Send a trigger here to immediately stop any ongoing burst.

        count (integer):
          Number of triggers to send in one burst.

        skip (integer):
          Number of time slots to wait before starting with the burst.

        output (trigger):
          The triggers are output here.

class Clocktool(DroidCircuit):
    """Circuit clocktool.

    Clock divider / multiplier / shifter

    Args:
        clock (trigger):
          Patch a steady clock here for this circuit to be of any use

        reset (trigger):
          A trigger here resets the internal counters. This is useful if you use the
          clock divider and want to restart the internal counting from 0, in order to
          align the clock divider with some external sequencers or the like

        divide (integer):
          Number to divide the clock through. This will be rounded to the nearest
          integer number. Note: if you want to use an external CV then you need to
          multiply that with some useful number, since otherwise you will get a number
          between 0 and 1 which is not useful at all. Remember: 10 V translates to a
          number of 1.

        multiply (integer):
          Number to multiply the clock with. Same considerations hold as for divide.

        dutycycle (bipolar):
          Output duty cycle of the clock – which is essentially a square wave – in a
          range from 0.0 to 1.0 or 0% to 100%. If you don't patch anything here, the
          length of the trigger output pulses will be 10 ms ('s standard trigger
          duration).

        gatelength (cv):
          This jack is alternative to dutycycle and will override it if it is used.
          It sets the length of each output pulse to a fixed value that is independent
          of the incoming clock. A value of 0.5 (a CV of 5 volts) translates into a gate
          length of 0.5 seconds.

        delay (cv):
          This CV allows you to shift the input clock beat around in time. A value of
          0.1 will delay each beat by 10% of a clock cycle. A value of -0.1 is also
          allowed and shifts the beat 10% ahead.  For an unmodulated delay -0.1 and 0.9
          is just the same, because the output clock will have the same relation to the
          input clock. But if you modify the delay from 0.0 to 0.9, the next tick will
          be delayed by 90% of one cycle, where is a modification from 0.0 to -0.1 will
          play the next tick by 10% earlier.

        output (gate):
          Here comes the modified clock

        inputpitch (cv):
          Experimental output that outputs a representation of the input clock's pitch
          on a 1V/octave base, based on the reference of 60 BPM (1 Hz). This means that
          an input clock of 120 BPM will output 1V (a value of 0.1), since 120 BPM it is
          one octave higher than 60 BPM. If you feed that value to the rate input of an
          LFO you get that running at exactly the same speed (not in the same phase,
          however).

        outputpitch (cv):
          Same for the modified output clock

    """Circuit triggerdelay.

    Trigger Delay with multi tap and optional clocking

    Args:
        input (gate):
          Patch triggers or gates to be delayed here.

        delay (cv):
          Amount of time the incoming triggers are being delayed. When clock is patched,
          this is in relation to one clock cycle, so a delay of 4 will delay the input
          pattern by exactly 4 beats. Fractions are allowed also. If clock is not
          patched, this parameter is in seconds. So for example in order to delay by
          100 ms you need a delay of 0.1.

        gatelength (cv):
          Unless you patch this jack the length of the output gates is exactly the
          length of the input gates. By use of this parameter you override that length
          and set a fixed length in seconds – or if clock is being used – in clock
          cycles.

        repeats (integer):
          Number of times the delayed trigger is being repeated. Each further repetition
          is with the same delay.

        mute (gate):
          A high gate signal suppresses any further output gates. However, the current
          gate is finished normally.

        clock (trigger):
          When you patch this input, the trigger delay runs in clocked mode. In this
          mode delay is relative to one clock cycle. I.e. a delay if 0.5 will delay the
          trigger by half a clock cycle. The same holds for gatelength. That is measured
          in clock cycles, too.

        output (gate):
          Outputs the delayed triggers/gates, while keeping the gate length – unless you
          have changed that

        overflow (gate):
          Whenever there are more input triggers than this circuit can keep memory of,
          this output outputs a gate of 0.5 sec length. You can wire this to an LED in
          order to know when this happens.
